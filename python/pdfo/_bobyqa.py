def bobyqa(fun, x0, args=(), bounds=None, options=None):
    r"""Bounded Optimization BY Quadratic Approximations.

    .. deprecated:: 1.3
        Calling the BOBYQA solver via the `bobyqa` function is deprecated.
        The BOBYQA solver remains available in PDFO. Call the `pdfo` function
        with the argument ``method='bobyqa'`` to use it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Objective function to be minimized.

            ``fun(x, *args) -> float``

        where ``x`` is an array with shape (n,) and `args` is a tuple.
    x0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial guess.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments of the objective function. For example,

            ``bobyqa(fun, x0, args, ...)``

        is equivalent to

            ``bobyqa(lambda x: fun(x, *args), x0, ...)``

    bounds : {`scipy.optimize.Bounds`, array_like, shape (n, 2)}, optional
        Bound constraints of the problem. It can be one of the cases below.

        #. An instance of `scipy.optimize.Bounds`.
        #. An array with shape (n, 2). The bound constraints for ``x[i]`` are
           ``bounds[i, 0] <= x[i] <= bounds[i, 1]``. Set ``bounds[i, 0]`` to
           :math:`-\infty` if there is no lower bound, and set ``bounds[i, 1]``
           to :math:`\infty` if there is no upper bound.

    options : dict, optional
        The options passed to the solver. Accepted options are:

            rhobeg: float, optional
                Initial value of the trust region radius, which should be a
                positive scalar. Typically, ``options['rhobeg']`` should be in
                the order of one tenth of the greatest expected change to a
                variable. By default, it is ``min(1, min(ub - lb) / 4)``, and
                ``0.5`` if the problem is scaled.
            rhoend: float, optional
                Final value of the trust region radius, which should be a
                positive scalar. ``options['rhoend']`` should indicate the
                accuracy required in the final values of the variables.
                Moreover, ``options['rhoend']`` should be no more than
                ``options['rhobeg']`` and is by default ``1e-6``.
            maxfev: int, optional
                Upper bound of the number of calls of the objective function
                `fun`. Its value must be not less than ``options['npt'] + 1``.
                By default, it is ``500 * n``.
            npt: int, optional
                Number of interpolation points of each model used in Powell's
                Fortran code.
            ftarget: float, optional
                Target value of the objective function. If a feasible iterate
                achieves an objective function value lower or equal to
                ```options['ftarget']``, the algorithm stops immediately. By
                default, it is :math:`-\infty`.
            scale: bool, optional
                Whether to scale the problem according to the bound constraints.
                By default, it is ``False``. If the problem is to be scaled,
                then ``rhobeg`` and ``rhoend`` will be used as the initial and
                final trust region radii for the scaled problem.
            honour_x0: bool, optional
                Whether to respect the user-defined ``x0``. By default, it is
                ``False``.
            quiet: bool, optional
                Whether the interface is quiet. If it is set to ``True``, the
                output message will not be printed. This flag does not interfere
                with the warning and error printing.
            classical: bool, optional
                Whether to call the classical Powell code or not. It is not
                encouraged in production. By default, it is ``False``.
            debug: bool, optional
                Debugging flag. It is not encouraged in production. By default,
                it is ``False``.
            chkfunval: bool, optional
                Flag used when debugging. If both ``options['debug']`` and
                ``options['chkfunval']`` are ``True``, an extra
                function/constraint evaluation would be performed to check
                whether the returned values of objective function and constraint
                match the returned ``x``. By default, it is ``False``.

        also be returned:

            infeasible_bounds : `numpy.ndarray`
                Indices of the bounds that are infeasible.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to solve a simple bound-constrained
    optimization problem. The problem considered below should be solved with a
    derivative-based method. It is used here only as an illustration.

    We consider the 2-dimensional problem

    .. math::

        \min_{x, y \in \R} \quad x^2 + y^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \left\{
        \begin{array}{l}
            0 \le x \le 2,\\
            1 / 2 \le y \le 3.
        \end{array} \right.

    We solve this problem using `bobyqa` starting from the initial guess
    :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (0, 1)` with at most 200 function evaluations.

    .. testsetup::

        import numpy as np
        np.set_printoptions(precision=1, suppress=True)

    >>> from pdfo import Bounds, bobyqa
    >>> bounds = Bounds([0, 0.5], [2, 3])
    >>> options = {'maxfev': 200}
    >>> res = bobyqa(lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2, [0, 1], bounds=bounds, options=options)
    >>> res.x
    array([0. , 0.5])

    Note that `bobyqa` can also be used to solve unconstrained problems.
