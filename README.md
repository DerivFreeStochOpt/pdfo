Dedicated to late Professor [M. J. D. Powell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html)
FRS (1936&ndash;2015).

We look forward to your feedback! Thank you very much!

## Getting started

PDFO (Powell's Derivative-Free Optimization solvers) is a cross-platform package
providing interfaces for using late Professor [M. J. D. Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html)
derivative-free optimization solvers, including UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA,
and COBYLA. See https://www.pdfo.net for more information.

- To use the MATLAB version of PDFO, see [README_mat.md](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/blob/main/README_mat.md).
- To use the Python version of PDFO, see [README_py.md](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/blob/main/README_py.md).

This package makes use of a modified version of [Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html)
Fortran code. See the folder [`original`](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/tree/main/fsrc/original)
under `fsrc` for [Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) original code.
