Dedicated to late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS (1936&ndash;2015).

We look forward to your feedback! Thank you very much!

## Getting started

PDFO (Powell's Derivative-Free Optimization solvers) is a cross-platform package
providing interfaces for using late Professor M. J. D. Powell's derivative-free
optimization solvers, including UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA, and COBYLA.
See https://www.pdfo.net for more information.

- To use the MATLAB version of PDFO, see [README_mat.txt](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/blob/main/README_mat.md).
- To use the Python version of PDFO, see [README_py.txt](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/blob/main/README_py.md).

This package makes use of a modified version of Powell's Fortran code. See
folder [original](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/tree/main/fsrc/original) for 
Powell's original code.
